Original mesh credits:

StarWars A-wing by Staffan Norling. The head of the pilot was 
created by Chris Wikoff (wikoff@earthlink.net)

May be freely distributed (but please send me a mail).
This document must be distributed with the mesh.

Made in 3D Studio MAX R2.0. 
The round part of the hull was created out of a quad-patch. 
Then the rest of the hull was created with Cap-Holes and 
edit mesh. Most of the details are primitives + edit mesh.
